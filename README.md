# Retail_sales_prediction
This project includes solving a real-world business problem of sales forecasting and building up a machine learning model for the sales prediction. Our main goal here is to predict the sales for six weeks for each store and find out the factors influencing in it and recommend ways in order to improve the numbers.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied. Two datasets are given: one with store data and the other with historical sales data of 1115 stores from January 2013 to July 2015. The main objective is to understand existing data and after identifying the key factors that will predict future sales, a predictive model will be built for making forecasts about future sales.)https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data.

# APPROACH


Understanding the business requirements.
Importing necessary libraries and defining essential functions.
Reading data from provided files.
Conducting data pre-processing, including inspecting and cleaning datasets.
Performing exploratory data analysis to identify factors influencing sales and understand their impact.
Engaging in feature engineering to prepare data for modeling.
Modeling the data and comparing models to identify the most suitable one for forecasting.
Drawing conclusions and providing recommendations to enhance sales.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Monday Sales Peak:
Mondays emerge as the highest sales day, possibly due to most Sundays being closed. This pattern suggests a strategic focus on Monday promotions or offerings.

Promotional Impact on Sales:
Promotions demonstrate a significant impact on sales, although not necessarily on the number of customers. Recommending an increased investment in promotions for higher returns.

Store Type B Success:
Store type B outperforms other types in both sales and customers per store. The suggestion is to consider opening more Store type B outlets to capitalize on this success.

Assortment B Preference:
Assortment B, exclusive to Store type B, stands out with higher sales and customer numbers. Recommending stocking more Assortment B items to meet customer demand effectively.

Mid-December Sales Peak:
Observing a peak in weekly sales and customers in mid-December, it's plausible that customers stock up on drugs before holiday closures. This insight suggests targeted marketing or promotions during this period for increased sales.
